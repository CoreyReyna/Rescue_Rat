# Rescue_Rat
This repository contains the code for the Rescue Rat project I worked on in my Digital Signal Processing Course. The Rescue Rat was coded on a TI Robotics Kit that used an MSP432 Launchpad.
The project used TI's Code Composer Studio, which is based in C/C++, and imcluded commercial sensors like a moisture detecting sensor and a motion sensor.
The project also included the use of the built in temperature sensor on the microcontroller. The combination of these sensors aimed to create a prototype robot that would aid in building collapses to satisfy our projects theme.
