# Rescue_Rat
This repository contains the code for the Rescue Rat project I worked on in my Digital Signal Processing Course. The Rescue Rat was coded on a TI Robotics Kit that used an MSP432 Launchpad.
The project used TI's Code Composer Studio, which is based in C/C++, and imcluded commercial sensors like a moisture detecting sensor, a CYT1033 from Spark Fun, and a motion sensor, a HC SR04 from Spark Fun.
The project also included the use of the built in temperature sensor on the microcontroller. The combination of these sensors aimed to create a prototype robot that would aid in building collapses to satisfy our projects theme. It's important to note that you need to download the driver library from TI in order for the code to work properly, as it is included in a header.
